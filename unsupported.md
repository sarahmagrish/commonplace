Welcome to our new digital magazine, Commonplace, which promises to be as much an adventure in new digital landscapes as it is an exploration of real geographies and communities on the ground.

We are very sorry but Commonplace cannot be viewed on your browser. We recommend installing the fast, free web browser Chrome <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/">Chrome.</a>

Our first issue focuses on the Skeena Basin in British Columbia—a vast, rugged, and still largely wild region of salmon rivers, ecological productivity and biological, cultural and linguistic diversity. But a series of recent developments have put the otherwise “remote” basin at the epicenter of global trends and convulsions; understanding the Skeena story is in many ways understanding our own story.

In an age of superstorms, financial meltdowns, and giant pipelines cutting through some of the last, best places on earth, it is clear we need a new approach—a new operating system for the 21st century. We believe this new approach starts at home, in the places we live, work, and play, and in the basic systems such as food, water, energy, shelter that we need to live well.

We invite you to visit the Skeena Basin and other singular places that are inspiring new ways of living and doing business while wrestling with the challenges of our times.
