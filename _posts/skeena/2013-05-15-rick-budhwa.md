Rick Budhwa came up the Skeena in the late ‘90s to work as an anthropologist for the office of the Wet’suwet’en, the First Nations group whose traditional territory ranges from Burns Lake in the east out to the coast range in the west. He was hired to apply his graduate research -- which examined how paleo-archeological events like landslides, earthquakes, and floods are reflected in oral tradition -- to current Wet'suwet'en resource management dilemmas. This type of work had implications in Canada’s legendary Delgamu’uk case–sixteen years of court proceedings that culminated in a landmark Supreme Court decision that gave First Nation oral traditions evidentiary weight in a court of law. 

Budhwa’s work supported the alignment of oral narratives with the geological and biological interpretation of ancient events. But it also affirmed that those traditions include vital information about technology, ethics, morality, family histories, and protocols for how to live your life. 

In 2004, he established the first full-spectrum cultural resource management organization in BC. “One of my great memories is hopping in a van for a ‘meeting’ with several elders and chiefs,” he says. “We drove to a place close to a river and pulled over and walked into a cut block–an area that had been harvested for forestry. I was looking at them and they were looking everywhere else–looking down and looking up, looking all around. They were touching trees. They were just…being there. It was a profound experience.”

Budhwa is now the principal of Crossroads Cultural Resource Management Ltd., research program manager of the Bulkley Valley Research Centre in Smithers and is an anthropology and First Nations studies professor at Northwest Community College.
